                <h3>Idaho City History</h3>
                <p class="padded-p">
                    During its peak in the mid-1860s, Idaho City swelled to a population of 7,000, making it the largest city in the Northwest. It holds a unique place in Masonic history, as the Grand Lodge of Idaho was founded here in 1867.
                </p>
                <p class="padded-p">
                    The town's prosperity during the gold rush attracted a significant Chinese population of 1,751, nearly half of the city's residents in 1870. Like many Chinese immigrants at the time, they came to work as miners or took up jobs as laundrymen and cooks in the area. Their legacy is still felt today in places like the Pon Yam House.
                </p>
                <p class="padded-p">
                    For those interested in its rich history, Idaho City is now a designated historic district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures within this district include the Boise County Courthouse, Masonic Hall, I.O.O.F. Hall, Boise Basin Mercantile Company, Idaho City Fire Station, and the Idaho City Schoolhouse, each preserving the town's fascinating past.

                <h3>Geography and Climate</h3>
                <p class="padded-p">
                    Idaho City is at the elevation 3907 feet above sea level.  
                </p>
                <p class="padded-p">
                    Idaho City features a classic Inland Northwest continental Mediterranean climate, with cold, snowy winters and warm, dry summers. This results in significant temperature fluctuations between day and night. The town experiences around 224.3 nights below freezing annually, surpassing Fairbanks, Alaska. It's notably colder than nearby Boise, with roughly 25.6 days below freezing and 12 nights dropping below 0°F. In terms of temperature, highs and lows vary, but typically range from the 20s to 40s (°F) during winters and the 70s to 90s (°F) in the summer. Due to its exposed location and higher altitude, Idaho City is both cooler and wetter than Boise, receiving twice the precipitation and nearly four times the snowfall, averaging 69.1 inches of snow, with a max depth of 74 inches in February 1949.
